# pysedm
Data Reduction Pipeline for the SEDmachine (no ready yet)

*This module is under development and is not yet ready to be used*

# Installation
Not ready yet

# Dependencies
- numpy, scipy, matpotlib
- shapely (pip install shapely)
  - _for the polygon matching in CCD to Spectrum. Might be moved to matplotlib_  
- propobject (pip install propobject)
  - _for the structure of the classes_
- astrobject (pip install astrobject)
  - _for the basic Image and Spectrum objects as well as low level tools_

#### Additional but not requested
- modefit (to be added to pip)
  - _for the fit of the spectral line and wavelength solution_
- pynverse (pip install pynverse)
  - _for a faster lbda<->pixels conversion in the wavelength solution (it's slower without pynverse)_
